# Hello Multiverse

in this readme, we are going to explain the lines of code in [hello.go](./hello.go)

1. package main - as of the time of writing this file, all i know is that you just need to import this package. though chatGPT is claiming that this is the entry point for your go program.\
2. import "fmt" - preprocessor command which tells the compiler to include the files lying in the package
3. func main() -this is the entry point for your go program
5. fmt.println() - this is the command to print the output of your go program
