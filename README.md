A repo for my go programming language

## go

Go is a statically typed, concurrent, and garbage-collected programming language created at Google

1. statically typed - variable types are checked at compile time rather than at runtime, this helps at catchin errors early in the development process.
2. concurrent - it is designed to handle multiple tasks at the same time, this is done using goroutines and channels.
3. garbage-collected - it automatically frees up memory that is no longer used by the program

Go is a popular language for building scalable network and web services, command-line utilities, and system-level programs.
